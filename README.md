Machine Learning Project – Multi-Dataset Analysis
📌 Objective
The main objective of this project was to explore and apply various machine learning techniques to multiple datasets from different domains. The goal was to develop predictive models, evaluate their performance, and extract meaningful insights that could help in real-world decision-making.

Datasets Used:

Iris Dataset – Classification of iris flowers into species based on sepal and petal measurements.

Credit Risk Dataset – Predicting whether a loan applicant is likely to default based on personal and financial attributes.

Churn Modelling Dataset – Identifying customers likely to leave a bank based on demographics, account history, and activity.

🛠 Approach
Data Exploration & Cleaning

Inspected datasets for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Applied relevant data preprocessing techniques such as handling null values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features (where required).

Feature Engineering

Converted categorical features into numerical form using One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.

Scaled continuous features using StandardScaler for better model convergence.

Selected key features based on correlation and domain knowledge.

Model Selection & Training

Used multiple classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, etc.).

Split datasets into training and testing sets for fair performance evaluation.

Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV where applicable.

Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score for classification tasks.

Confusion Matrices for visual evaluation of predictions.

📊 Results & Insights
Iris Dataset
Achieved near-perfect classification accuracy (≈ 97–100%) with simple algorithms due to dataset simplicity and balanced nature.

Petal length and petal width were the most important predictors of species.

Credit Risk Dataset
Feature scaling improved Logistic Regression results.

Balanced data was crucial — SMOTE oversampling helped improve recall for the “default” class.

Random Forest achieved the best overall accuracy and recall for risky customers.

Churn Modelling Dataset
Geography, tenure, and number of products were strong churn predictors.

Customers with lower tenure and fewer products were more likely to churn.

Gradient Boosting Classifier performed best, offering higher recall on churn cases.

💡 Key Takeaways
Data preprocessing and feature selection have a huge impact on performance.

Different datasets require different handling — balancing methods for imbalanced data significantly improve results.

Ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting often outperform basic models, but simple models can still be effective on clean, well-separated datasets like Iris.
🚀 Future Work
Apply deep learning models for more complex datasets.

Explore advanced feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, LDA).

Deploy best-performing models using Flask or Streamlit for interactive prediction.
